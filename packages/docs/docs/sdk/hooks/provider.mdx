# Provider

The `Provider` is a React component that wraps your application and provides the necessary context to the hooks to interact with the Unruggable Meme framework.

## Props

If both `factory` and `provider` props are not provided, the hooks will use the default provider interface.

      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Required</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>factory</td>
      <td>Factory</td>
      <td>
        The core sdk Factory instance to use in the hooks.
        If the factory client is provided, the `provider` prop will be ignored.
